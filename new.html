          <span>My Love,</span>
          <br />
          My life has always felt like a scattered jigsaw puzzle pieces missing, edges rough, and nothing quite fitting the way it should. There were gaps I couldn't fill, moments that felt incomplete, and a picture that never seemed whole.

          But then you came into my life, and suddenly, everything started to make sense. You were the missing piece, the one I had been searching for all along. With you, the broken fragments of my world fell into place, and the emptiness faded away.
          
          You didnâ€™t just complete my puzzle you solved it. You brought color where there was once only confusion, warmth where there was once cold, and love where there was once longing. Now, every moment with you is like finding the right piece, making my life more beautiful with each passing day.
          
          Thank you for being the answer to what I never knew was a question. Thank you for making my life whole. I love you endlessly.
